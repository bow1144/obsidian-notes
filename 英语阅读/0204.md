【Para.1】Romeo was about three years older than Juliet, Darcy was eight years Elizabeth Bennet’s senior and when Richard Burton first laid eyes on Elizabeth Taylor she was 21 and he was 28. Yet a study suggests that the idea of women being [drawn](####drawn) to older men is a myth, and that both sexes are — initially, at least — more likely to be attracted to younger partners.

【Para.2】The study looked at more than 6,000 single men and women aged between 22 and 85 years who went on more than 4,000 [blind](####blind) dates arranged by a [matchmaking](####matchmaking) company. The researchers looked at whether after a first in-person meeting, they wanted to have another one. The chances that they did were greater — for both sexes — if the partner was younger.
- 研究表明：两性都喜欢年轻的

【Para.3】The results may [align](####align) with evolutionary theories of mating, where youth suggests [fertility](). But they were unexpected, because a host of other studies have shown that in long-term relationships, men tend to be older than women.
- 另一研究：长期关系中，男人喜欢老女人

【Para.4】There are plenty of celebrity examples where the opposite is true. Cher, Demi Moore and Madonna have dated, or married, partners who have been more than a decade (and in Cher’s case, four decades) younger than them.

【Para.5】But according to a UN report that looked at more than 200 countries, men are four years older than women, on average, when they marry for the first time.

【Para.6】Professor Paul Eastwick of the University of California, Davis, who led the study, said: “After a blind date, participants were more attracted to younger partners, and this trend was equally true for men and women. This is very surprising, given that women say they want an older partner in nearly every study that has ever been [conducted](####conduct). Before this study, anyone would have assumed that the average age difference in couples means that men are initially attracted to younger women and women are initially attracted to older men.”

【Para.7】He and his colleagues found a **modest** but significant trend, **equivalent** to men and women preferring younger partners about 55 of the time and older about 45 percent.
- 男女：喜欢年轻/老的比例相似

【Para.8】Eastwick said: “Here’s another way of thinking about it: there is a medium-sized effect such that men desire women more than women desire men — you see this in most initial attraction studies. In our study, you’d need to [set a woman up](####set sb. up) with a man seven years younger than her to [erase](####erase) that overall gender difference. **That is, being seven years younger has about the same [effect](####effect) on desire as being a woman (as opposed to being a man).”**
- **That is** 后面的话很重要，起到总结的作用
- 年轻七岁对欲望的影响等同于女性对男性的影响

【Para.9】There are, he added, several theories that might explain the results. It is possible that youth wins in “initial attraction settings”, but relationships are more likely to form and last when the man is older. **Or perhaps society is organised in a way that means men get to [exert](####exert) their preferences more than women get to exert theirs.**

- 也许：社会的组织方式使得，男人比女人更能发挥他们的优势

【Para.10】The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

【Para.11】Eastwick said: “**I hope this experiment reminds people that what you say you want — the ideas in your head about what a good romantic partner looks like — often fails to match what you will actually find [appealing](####appeal) when you meet someone face-to-face.”**
